# clinchor

**clinchor** is a specialized software tool designed for the calculation of growth rates of multi-bunch beam modes in particle accelerators. It can be used to analyze and predict beam instabilitiesâ€”a critical aspect of designing and operating high-performance accelerator systems.

Detailed documentation is available in the **[clinchor manual](https://ops.aps.anl.gov/manuals/spiffe_latest/spiffe.pdf)**.

## Features
**clinchor** offers a robust set of capabilities tailored to beam physics analysis:
- **Growth Rate Calculations:** Computes growth rates for various multi-bunch beam modes with precision.
- **Flexible Configurations:** Supports a variety of accelerator setups, allowing customization to specific systems.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplifies parameter input for efficient workflow.
- **Analysis-Ready Outputs:** Generates results in formats suitable for further processing or visualization.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up **clinchor** on your system:
1. **Clone the SDDS and clinchor Repositories**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rtsoliday/SDDS.git
git clone https://github.com/rtsoliday/clinchor.git
```
2. **Compile**
```sh
cd clinchor
make
```

## Usage
